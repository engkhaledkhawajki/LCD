Overview
This project revolutionizes lung cancer diagnosis by leveraging advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. The primary focus is on the segmentation of lung CT scans using a UNet architecture and a fusion of features extracted from VGG16, Local Binary Pattern (LBP), and Gabor filters. The classification is performed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers, with an emphasis on enhancing discriminative power and interpretability.

Key Components
1. UNet for CT Scan Segmentation
Utilized a UNet architecture for accurate and detailed segmentation of lung CT scans.
UNet enables precise identification and isolation of lung structures, a crucial step in lung cancer diagnosis.

2. Feature Fusion with VGG16, LBP, and Gabor Features
Extracted features from multiple sources, including VGG16, LBP, and Gabor filters.
Fused these features to capture diverse information and improve the overall performance of the classification model.

3. SVM Classifiers with Cluster-Based Feature Selection
Employed SVM classifiers for robust lung cancer classification.
Implemented cluster-based feature selection techniques to enhance the relevance and discriminative power of the chosen features.

4. Decision Profile (Customized Ensemble)
The Decision Profile introduces a set of machine learning experiments (SVCs) using different kernels, features, and preprocessing pipelines. It aggregates decisions from classifiers with options like hard voting, soft voting, and weighted voting, with specific requirements for probability parameters.
5. Interpretability in the Context of Lung Cancer Diagnosis: A Technical Insight
In the pursuit of unraveling the decision-making process of complex neural networks involved in lung cancer diagnosis, the technical intricacies of interpretability tools like LIME Image become pivotal. LIME, standing for Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations, is a methodology designed to provide transparent and understandable insights into the predictions made by black-box models, including deep neural networks.
